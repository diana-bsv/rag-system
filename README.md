# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System  

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which combines retrieval-based and generative approaches to enhance the quality and relevance of generated content.

## Overview

The RAG system is designed to retrieve relevant information from a database or external knowledge source and incorporate it into a generative modelâ€™s responses. This approach improves the relevance and accuracy of generated outputs, especially for complex or knowledge-intensive tasks.
